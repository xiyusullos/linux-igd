Things on the table to do:

-- Add autoconf and automake to the project to configure for different archs.

-- Add a config file to be able to place the commands for the underlying firewall
   system in, so that they can be user configurable without recompiling.

-- Add iptables rules to allow port forwards, not just enable DNAT entries

-- Redo the install file

-- Lots of other memory and procedural cleanups
