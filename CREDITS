CREDITS
=============

Before anyone thanks me or credits me with any of this, please remember without a few people
none of this would have been possible.  The code from Genmei Mori in his psuedoicsd helped 
tremendously to get us started, and some of his code is still visible today.  I'll also be
including some of the names here of the people who contributed significant help with the 
project.

But the truth is, all the thanks belongs to someone else.  This project began, becuase
I needed something easier to use than Netmeeting to talk to a girl that I cared deeply about.
Windows Messenger was the way to go, but being paranoid as I am, and as most of you who are
reading this are, I needed a way to get through my linux firewall.  She is the reason for 
this.  She inspired me to write this program, and throught the year, she kept me inspired 
without knowing it, to get back to working on it.  This program has helped to connect 
me with an extremely important part of my life, and it makes me feel good to think that
it might help someone else stay in contact with people important to them as well. 
So please, all the work I've done on this program, I owe it all to her. I appreciate 
all the good comments as well as the bad  ;-) but she deserves all of the thanks.  If
anyone agrees, you can always drop me a line, and I'll make sure she knows.  Thanks.  


With that said (and sorry for the history lesson, but she deserves it), here's a list
(in no particular order) of some important people with the linux igd project.  Thanks to all
of you who have contributed code, bug reports, and just plain kicked me in the ass to
get me going again on it.

Genmei Mori
Original Author of Psuedoicsd which was the foundation 
and stepping stone for Linux IGD.

Glover George
Why am I giving credit to myself?  You guys know who I am. :-)

Eric Wirt
Co-founder of Linux IGD with Glover.  Helps out with all 
aspects of the program including Web Site, Forums, Mailing Lists,
etc.  Basically keeps me in line. :-).
