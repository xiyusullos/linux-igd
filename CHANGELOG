-- Note to everyone, these are by no means complete, since I can't remember half the time
   what i did.  And I know they are not professional changelogs, I mean come on, I'm 23,
   I'm still a kid :-) 

Version 0.92 -- 01/13/2003
   GG -- Fixed issues with Direct Play games not deleting broadcast port mappings
         So most if not all Direct Play games will now work correctly.
      -- Added Byte and Packet counter code contributed by giussani
      -- Changed all the xml and skl files to include our UUID and some other updated
         information that needed to be changed.
      -- Added a CREDITS file to make sure I give thanks to the person who inspired
         me to write this program, along with everyone else who's contributing.
      -- Fixed the startup message in messages to report the correct version now.
      -- Once again, other small changes i can't remember  

Version 0.91 -- 12/29/2002
   GG -- Fixed the port mapping delete's, which was an entire botch in version 0.90
   GG -- Some more general cleanups to the code

Version 0.90 -- 12/24/2002
   GG -- Too Many changes to remember, it's been a while but here's what works now
   GG -- File Transfer Seems to be working (at least for me, i don't swear to it)
   GG -- You can now view your portmapping listings from windows XP with the connection icon
   GG    You can only view portmappnigs once some are added, so wait a few minutes
   GG -- Lots of restructuring of the code to more modularize it, allowing people to work
   GG    on different parts.
   GG -- The uptime in the Windows XP Connection Icon works properly now
   GG -- File transfer works, did i tell you? :-) I haven't been sending files just like you guys.
   GG -- More things that i'll add in the next version's changelog, it's christmas, i'm taking a break
   GG    (Most of you think i've been taking a break :-)) 

Version 0.75 -- 05/15/2002
   GG -- Changed the program to run as a true daemon now, forking into the
         backround properly
   GG -- Added some signal hooks to allow the program to be shut down with a
         killall upnpd.
   GG -- Removed some of the excessive debugging found in previous version in
         /var/log/debug.
   GG -- Made some relevant changes to the INSTALL, README, and SECURITY files.
   GG -- Placed the code into CVS on source forge.
   GG -- Usage now prints to STDOUT where it should have in the first place.
   GG -- When the daemon is running, in Windows a connection description now 
         shows up in Network Connections representing the gateway connection.
         Windows has always recognized it this way, but until now you didn't
         have a way to view the connection details.

Version 0.71 -- 05/03/2002
   GG -- Ok I goofed, and still had it statically grabbing one of the ip
         addresses.  This is the real officil first real official release,
         so let us know what you think.  

Version 0.70 -- 05/03/2002
   GG -- First public release of the software.  We figure it's time to share
         the glory and the shame.
